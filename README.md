How to set up a simple dockerized RabbitMQ cluster

RabbitMQ is the most widely deployed open source message broker.

RabbitMQ is lightweight and easy to deploy on premises and in the cloud. It supports multiple messaging protocols. RabbitMQ can be deployed in distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale, high-availability requirements.

RabbitMQ runs on many operating systems and cloud environments, and provides a wide range of developer tools for most popular languages.
